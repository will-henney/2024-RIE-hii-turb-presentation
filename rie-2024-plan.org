* New idea for RIE 2024 talk

** New title
How I thought I had discovered 100 new optical emission lines, and how it turned out that they were not so new after all

Google translate seems fine

Cómo pensé que había descubierto 100 nuevas líneas de emisión óptica y cómo resultó que, después de todo, no eran tan nuevas

** Plan
1. How it started: looking for Raman scattering by neutral hydrogen in the SMC
   - (yes we found it but that is a different story)
   - Show JWST image of the region
2. Show spectra with the guardian lines around the Raman O I dip
   - Call these lines the Guardians because they look like the Gates of Argonath
   - no, maybe just don't
3. Show the energy level diagram for H2 to show which our lines are
   - they are for delta v = 3 to 7
   - we can plot all the transitions as functions of wavelength
   - there are 4712 bound levels in all
     - v = 14 is the highest bound vibrational level, and it only goes up to J=4, with excitation temperature 52000 K
     - so it is not surprising that v = 14 is the highest level that we detect
   - strongest lines we see are
     - 4-1 in the far red
     - 5-1 around H alpha

* Original idea on turbulent H II regions, which I have now ditched


- Duration: 10 minutes
- Title: Orden y desorden en regiones fotoionizadas
- Language: do the slides in English and talk in Spanish
  - or vice versa?

** Plan
- Last time I had 9 slides, which was about right I think
- I used a dark mode, but that meant lots of faffing around to get the figures converted
  - this time I cannot be bothered
  - I have now partially converted the theme to light mode

** Content
- Motivation
  - What drives the kinematics of H II regions?
  - How can we study it observationally?
    - Two types of technique:
      - Line widths
      - Plane-of-sky variations
